title: Model.yaml Reference
layout: default
---
The model.yaml file is the heart of every Constellaxion project. It defines what model you‚Äôre using, what dataset to train on (if any), and where to deploy it.

# Model.yaml Reference

After you run:
```bash
constellaxion init
```
Once initialized, Constellaxion generates a job.json file based on your model.yaml.

## üìÇ Example: Deployment Only (No Training)
```yaml
model:
  id: cxn-foundation-model
  base: tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct

deploy:
  gcp:
    project_id: my-gcp-project
    location: europe-west2
```

## üìÇ Example: Fine-Tuning
```yaml
model:
  id: crypto-sentiment-v2
  base: tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct

dataset:
  train: ./train.csv
  val: ./val.csv
  test: ./test.csv

training:
  epochs: 1
  batch_size: 16

deploy:
  gcp:
    project_id: my-gcp-project
    location: europe-west2
```
This version includes local dataset files and training configuration for fine-tuning a base model.


üîç Field Reference

### model
<dl>
	<dt>id (string)</dt> 
  <dd>The unique label for this project or experiment.</dd>
	<dt>base (string)</dt> 
  <dd>The Hugging Face model ID used as the starting point for deployment or fine-tuning.</dd>
</dl>

### dataset (required if fine-tuning)
- Paths to your local training, validation, and test datasets (CSV format)
- All CSVs must have two columns: prompt and response
```yaml
dataset:
  train: ./train.csv
  val: ./val.csv
  test: ./test.csv
```

### training (required if fine-tuning)
Configuration for fine-tuning. This section is required if dataset is present.
```yaml
training:
  epochs: 1
  batch_size: 16
```
You can extend this section with additional parameters in the future (e.g., learning rate, optimizer, etc.)


### deploy
Describes where and how to deploy the model.
```yaml
deploy:
  gcp:
    project_id: my-gcp-project
    location: europe-west2
```


<dl>
	<dt>project_id (string)</dt> 
  <dd>Your GCP project ID</dd>
	<dt>location (string)</dt> 
  <dd>GCP region where jobs run</dd>
	<dt>provider</dt> 
  <dd>is inferred internally from the presence of the gcp or aws block</dd>
</dl>

## üìå Notes
- model.yaml is user-authored and committed to version control
- job.json is generated from it and should not be edited manually
- If you edit model.yaml, run constellaxion init again to refresh your project state
